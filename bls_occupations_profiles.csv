Architects typically need a bachelor's degree in architecture. Most architects earn their degree through a 5-year Bachelor of Architecture degree program. Many earn a master’s degree in architecture, which can take 1 to 5 additional years. The time required depends on the extent of the student’s previous education and training in architecture. A typical bachelor’s degree program includes courses in architectural history and theory, building design with an emphasis on computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), structures, construction methods, professional practices, math, physical sciences, and liberal arts. About two-thirds of states require that architects hold a degree in architecture from one of more than 120 schools of architecture accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). State licensing requirements can be found at the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB). All state architectural registration boards require architecture graduates to complete a lengthy paid internship—generally lasting 3 years—before they may sit for the Architect Registration Examination. Most new graduates complete their training period by working at architectural firms through the Architectural Experience Program (AXP), a program run by NCARB that guides students through the internship process. Some states allow a portion of the training to occur in the offices of employers in related careers, such as engineers and general contractors. Architecture students who complete internships while still in school can count some of that time toward the 3-year training period. Interns in architectural firms may help design part of a project. They may help prepare architectural documents and drawings, build models, and prepare construction drawings on CADD. Interns may also research building codes and write specifications for building materials, installation criteria, the quality of finishes, and other related details.

Candidates do not have to pass all four parts at once, but most states require that candidates pass all four parts within 18 months of passing their first part. All states require CPAs to take continuing education courses, including ethics, to maintain their license. Certification provides an advantage in the job market because it shows professional competence in a specialized field of accounting and auditing. Accountants and auditors seek certifications from a variety of professional societies. Some of the most common certifications are listed below: The AICPA offers several designations. For accountants with a CPA, the AICPA offers the Accredited in Business Valuation (ABV), Certified Financial Forensics (CFF), Certified Information Technology Professional (CITP), and Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) certifications. All of these credentials require experience in the related area, continuing education, and passing an exam. AICPA and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) developed the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation as an internationally recognized professional credential. Candidates must complete a program, pass an exam, and meet a requirement for work experience. The Association of Government Accountants (AGA) offers the Certified Government Financial Manager (CGFM) credential to accountants or auditors working with federal, state, or local government. To earn this certification, candidates must have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university, pass examinations, and have professional-level experience in government financial management. To keep the certification, CGFMs must complete continuing professional education. The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) offers the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) credential to graduates from accredited colleges and universities who have work experience as internal auditors and have passed an exam. The IIA also offers the Certified in Control Self-Assessment (CCSA), Certified Government Auditing Professional (CGAP), Certified Financial Services Auditor (CFSA), and Certification in Risk Management Assurance (CRMA) to those who pass the exams and meet educational and experience requirements. The Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) offers the Certified Management Accountant (CMA) to applicants who complete a bachelor’s degree. Applicants must have work experience in management accounting, pass an exam, agree to meet continuing education requirements, and comply with standards of professional conduct. ISACA offers the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) to candidates who pass an exam and have work experience auditing information systems. Information systems experience, financial or operational auditing experience, or related college credit hours may be substituted for some of the experience required in information systems auditing, control, or security. Some top executives and financial managers have a background in accounting, internal auditing, or finance. Entry-level public accountants may advance to senior positions as they gain experience and take on more responsibility. Those who excel may become supervisors, managers, or partners; open their own public accounting firm; or transfer to executive positions in management accounting or internal auditing in private firms. Management accountants often start as cost accountants, junior internal auditors, or trainees for other accounting positions. As they rise through the organization, they may advance to become accounting managers, budget directors, chief cost accountants, or managers of internal auditing. Some become controllers, treasurers, financial vice presidents, chief financial officers, or corporation presidents. Public accountants, management accountants, and internal auditors may move from one type of accounting and auditing to another. Public accountants often move into management accounting or internal auditing. Management accountants may become internal auditors, and internal auditors may become management accountants. However, it is less common for management accountants or internal auditors to move into public accounting. Analytical and critical-thinking skills. Accountants and auditors must be able to critically evaluate data, identify issues in documentation, and suggest solutions. For example, internal auditors might detect fraudulent use of funds, and public accountants may work to minimize tax liability. Communication skills. Accountants and auditors must be able to listen to and discuss facts and concerns from clients, managers, and other stakeholders. They must also be able to discuss the results of their work both in meetings and in written reports. Detail oriented. Accountants and auditors must pay attention to detail when compiling and examining documents. Math skills. Accountants and auditors must be able to analyze, compare, and interpret facts and figures.

Licensing requirements for claims adjusters, appraisers, examiners, and investigators vary by state. Some states have few requirements; others require either completing prelicensing education or receiving a satisfactory score on a licensing exam (or both). Jobseekers should verify the licensing laws with the state and locality in which they want to work. In some states, claims adjusters employed by insurance companies do not have to become licensed themselves because they can work under the company license. Public adjusters may need to meet separate or additional requirements. Some states that require licensing also require a certain number of continuing education credits per year to renew the license. Federal and state laws and the outcomes of claim disputes adjudicated in court affect how the claims must be handled and what insurance policies can and must cover. Examiners working on life and health claims must stay up to date on new medical procedures and prescription drugs. Examiners working on auto claims must be familiar with the most recent car models and repair techniques. To fulfill their continuing education requirements, workers can attend classes or workshops, write articles for claims publications, or give lectures and presentations.

They appraise only properties that house one to four units.","The requirements to become a fully qualified property appraiser or assessor are complex and vary by state and, sometimes, by the value or type of property. These workers typically need a bachelor’s degree, although some qualify with a high school diploma. Appraisers of real estate also must meet state licensure or certification requirements. Check with your state's licensing board for specific requirements. Although requirements vary, property appraisers and assessors typically need a bachelor’s degree. Common fields of degree include business, social science, and psychology. College courses in subjects such as computer science, finance, and business or real estate law may be useful for prospective appraisers and assessors. Most states set education and experience requirements that assessors must meet in order to practice. A few states have no statewide requirements; instead, each locality sets the standards. In some localities, candidates may qualify with a high school diploma. Employers may require new workers to take basic appraisal courses and complete on-the-job training that lasts 12 months or more. Appraisers and assessors also may need to work enough hours to meet requirements for licensing or certification. Federal law requires appraisers of real estate to have a state license or certification when working on federally related transactions, such as appraisals for loans made by federally insured banks and financial institutions. The Appraisal Foundation (TAF) offers information on appraisal licensing. There is no such federal requirement for appraisers of personal and business property or for assessors, although some states require certification. For state-specific requirements, applicants should contact their state licensing board. Real estate appraisers usually value one property at a time, while assessors value many at once. However, both occupations use similar methods and techniques. As a result, assessors and appraisers often take the same courses for certification. In addition to passing a statewide examination, candidates must usually complete a set number of on-the-job hours. The credential level determines what type of property a real estate appraiser may value. There are four federal appraiser classifications: Licensed Trainee Appraiser, Licensed Residential Appraiser, Certified Residential Appraiser, and Certified General Appraiser. Each credential requires different education and training to complete. All of them except for the Trainee License also require that candidates receive instruction on the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and pass an exam. The American Society of Appraisers (ASA) offers information on professional appraisers representing all disciplines: Appraisal Review and Management, Business Valuation, Gems and Jewelry, Machinery and Technical Specialties, Personal Property and Real Property. Unlike appraisers of real estate, neither appraisers of personal and business property nor assessors have federal requirements for certification. In states that mandate certification for assessors, the requirements are usually similar to those for appraisers. For example, the International Association of Assessing Officers (IAAO) offers the Certified Assessment Evaluator (CAE) credential covering topics such as property valuation, assessment administration, and property tax policy. In states that do not require certification for assessors, employers may require candidates to take basic appraisal courses, complete on-the-job training, and meet the work-hours requirements for appraisal licenses or certificates. Assessors also may get a state appraiser license or credential. Both appraisers and assessors must take continuing education courses to keep their license or certification. Requirements vary by state and credential. Analytical skills. Property appraisers and assessors use many sources of data when estimating values. As a result, they must research and evaluate all factors before determining their estimate and producing a final report. Customer-service skills. Because appraisers regularly interact with clients, being polite and friendly is important. Math skills. Analyzing real estate data for valuation requires making calculations, such as square footage of land and building space, so workers must have good math skills. Organizational skills. To successfully accomplish tasks related to appraising and assessing property, these workers need to keep good records and be methodical in completing their tasks. Problem-solving skills. Appraising or assessing a property's value may involve unexpected problems. The ability to develop and apply alternative solutions is crucial to successfully completing the appraisal and report on time. Time-management skills.

Many workers learn their jobs by operating light equipment, such as a trench roller, under the guidance of an experienced operator. Later, they may operate heavier equipment, such as bulldozers. Operators of some equipment, such as machines with computerized controls, may need more training and some understanding of electronics. Other workers learn their trade through a 3- or 4-year apprenticeship. For each year of a typical program, apprentices must complete a predetermined number of hours of technical instruction and paid on-the-job training. Apprenticeship program requirements differ based on the type of program and by region. During technical instruction, apprentices learn operating procedures for equipment as well as safety practices, first aid, and how to read grading plans. On the job, apprentices learn to maintain equipment, operate machinery, and use technology, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) devices. After completing an apprenticeship program, apprentices are considered journey workers and perform tasks with less guidance. Construction equipment operators often need a commercial driver’s license (CDL) to haul their equipment to various jobsites. State laws governing CDLs vary. A few states have special licenses for operators of backhoes, loaders, and bulldozers. Some states and cities require pile driver operators to have a crane license, because similar operational concerns apply to both pile drivers and cranes. Requirements vary by state.

Many actors continue to train through workshops, rehearsals, or mentoring by a drama coach. Every role is different, and an actor may need to learn something new for each one. For example, a role may require learning how to sing or dance, or an actor may have to learn to speak with an accent or to play a musical instrument or sport. Many aspiring actors begin by participating in school plays or local theater productions. In television and film, actors usually start out in smaller roles or independent movies and work their way up to bigger productions.

They often begin training at a young age and may compete on club teams or in high school and collegiate athletics. In addition, athletes may improve their skills by taking private or group lessons or attending sports camps. It typically takes many years of practice and experience to become an athlete or sports competitor. Some sports and states require athletes and sports competitors to be licensed or certified to practice. For example, racecar drivers need a driver’s license issued by their state and a certification or license from an automobile racing organization to compete in some races. State licensing boards and professional athletics associations, which serve as governing bodies of various sports, may revoke licenses and suspend participants who do not meet the required performance or training. In addition, athletes may have their licenses or certification suspended for inappropriate activity. Turning professional is often the biggest advancement that aspiring athletes make in their careers. They may begin to compete immediately, although some also may spend more time on the bench (as a reserve) to gain experience. In some sports, such as baseball, athletes may begin their professional career on a minor league team before moving up to the major leagues. Professional athletes generally advance in their sport by displaying superior performance and receiving accolades; in turn, they typically earn a higher salary. They also may receive endorsements from companies and brands. Athleticism. Athletes and sports competitors need athletic ability to compete against opponents. Concentration. Athletes and sports competitors must focus when competing, which includes being able to block out distractions from fans and opponents. Decision-making skills.

Organizations specific to various sports, such as golf or tennis, may offer certification for coaches. Check with the sport’s national governing body for information on approved programs. To reach the rank of a professional coach, a candidate typically needs years of coaching experience and a winning record at a college. Coaches who do not have coaching experience may still be hired at the professional level if they were successful as an athlete in their sport. Some college coaches begin their careers as graduate assistants or assistant coaches to gain the experience and knowledge needed to become a head coach. Large schools and colleges that compete at the highest levels require a head coach who has had substantial experience at another school or as an assistant coach. Other college coaches may begin out as high school coaches before moving up to the collegiate level. Scouts may begin working as talent spotters in a particular area or region. They typically advance to become supervising scouts responsible for a whole territory or region. Communication skills. Because coaches instruct, organize, and motivate athletes, they must be able to convey information clearly. They must communicate proper techniques, strategies, and rules of the sport effectively enough for every player on the team to understand. Decision-making skills. Coaches must choose the appropriate players to use during a game and the proper time to use game-managing tools, such as timeouts. Coaches and scouts also must be selective when recruiting players. Dedication. Coaches must attend daily practices and assist their team and individual athletes in improving their skills and physical conditioning. Coaches must be dedicated to their sport, as it often takes years to become successful. Interpersonal skills. Being able to relate to athletes helps coaches and scouts foster positive relationships with their current players and in recruiting potential players. Leadership skills.

However, specific requirements may vary. Most judges and magistrates must be appointed or elected to their positions, a process that often requires political support. Many local and state judges are appointed to serve fixed, renewable terms that may have mandatory retirement ages ranging from 65 to 75. Federal and some state judges are appointed for life. Judicial nominating commissions screen candidates for judgeships in many states and for some federal judgeships. A Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree is typically required for jobs as a local, state, or federal judge or hearing officer. Earning a law degree usually takes 7 years of full-time study after high school: 4 years of undergraduate study in any field, followed by 3 years of law school. Law degree programs include courses such as constitutional law, contracts, property law, civil procedure, and legal writing. Although a J.D. is typical, requirements for these positions may vary. Hearing officers, magistrates, and even judges in some jurisdictions are not required to have a law degree. Judges and hearing officers typically learn their skills through years of experience as practicing lawyers. Some states allow those who are not lawyers to hold limited-jurisdiction positions as judges, magistrates, or hearing officers, but opportunities are better for those with experience practicing law. In addition to earning a law degree, federal administrative law judges typically need 7 years of experience as a licensed attorney. They also must pass a competitive exam from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Some law school graduates who are interested in becoming a judge pursue a judicial clerkship prior to working as a lawyer. Clerkships are typically a specified length of time, such as 1- or 2-year terms, and help law school graduates develop skills required for a legal career. Clerks may need to have passed the bar exam prior to hiring, but they may work without a law license because they have limited duties and are not yet practicing lawyers. Newly elected or appointed judges and hearing officers sometimes have training requirements. This training may include mock trial sessions, mentorship from experienced judges or hearing officers, and courses on topics such as judicial ethics or relations with news media. Judges and hearing officers also may be required to take continuing legal education courses throughout their careers. Judges typically must maintain a law license and good standing with their state bar association. Advancement for some judicial workers means moving to courts with broader jurisdiction, such as from lower court to appellate court. Advancement for various hearing officers includes taking on more complex cases, practicing law, and becoming district court judges. Analytical skills.

Becoming a lawyer usually takes 7 years of full-time study after high school: 4 years of undergraduate study followed by 3 years of law school. Although most law schools do not require a specific bachelor's degree for entry, common undergraduate fields of study include law and legal studies, history, and social science. Most states and jurisdictions require lawyers to earn a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association (ABA). ABA-accredited programs include courses such as constitutional law, contracts, property law, civil procedure, and legal writing. As part of their admissions process, law schools may consider an applicant’s score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). LSAT questions cover reasoning, writing, and other aptitudes needed for the study of law. Those interested in pursuing a career in some legal fields may need to meet additional requirements. For example, patent lawyers typically need a degree, specific credits, or a background in science or engineering and must pass an exam administered by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (commonly known as the patent bar exam). Tax lawyers may choose to earn a Master of Laws (LL.M) degree in tax after completing a J.D. program. Prospective lawyers take a licensing exam, called the “bar exam.” Most states have adopted the Uniform Bar Exam, which is coordinated by the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE). A score from the uniform exam is transferable across jurisdictions that accept it. Lawyers who receive a license to practice law are “admitted to the bar.” Each state’s highest court establishes its rules for bar admission. Rules for federal courts differ, and requirements vary by state and jurisdiction. For more details on individual state and jurisdiction requirements, visit the NCBE. Most states require that applicants graduate from an ABA-accredited law school, pass the written bar exam, and be found by an admitting board to have the character to represent and advise others. Prior felony convictions, academic misconduct, and a history of substance abuse are examples of factors that may disqualify an applicant from being admitted to the bar. Lawyers who want to practice in more than one state usually must meet licensing requirements for each state in which they wish to work. Most states have reciprocity agreements that streamline the process for lawyers licensed in one state to get licensed in another state. After bar admission, lawyers must keep informed about legal developments that affect their practice. States may require lawyers to participate in continuing legal education to maintain licensure. Law students who have completed their first or second year of law school may be eligible for part-time jobs or summer internships in law firms, government agencies, and organizations’ legal departments. Gaining experience in these summer positions may help law students decide on an area of legal focus for their careers. As for students in many fields, successful completion of a summer job or internship may result in an offer of employment after graduation. Some law school graduates pursue a judicial clerkship prior to working as a lawyer. Clerkships are typically a specified length of time, such as 1- or 2-year terms, and help law school graduates develop skills required for a legal career. Judges may prefer to hire clerks who have passed the bar exam, but clerks may work without a law license because they have limited duties and are not yet practicing lawyers. Newly hired attorneys usually start as associates and work on teams with more experienced lawyers. Some lawyers advance to become partners, which means that they are partial owners of the firm. After gaining experience, some lawyers go into practice for themselves. Others may move to a large organization, either working in its legal department or as in-house counsel. Some experienced lawyers become judges. Most judges must be appointed or elected to their positions, a procedure that often requires political support. Analytical skills. Lawyers interpret the law as it applies to their client’s case. They must be able to evaluate large amounts of information, interpret relevant findings, and apply them to facts. Communication skills. Lawyers must be able to clearly present and explain information to clients, opposing parties, and other members of the legal community.

Personal trainers also may learn how to develop fitness programs for clients of all ages. Most fitness trainers or instructors have certification related to the area of fitness in which they specialize. Personal trainers usually must be certified before they begin working with clients or with members of a gym or health club. Group fitness instructors may begin work without certification, but employers often encourage or require them to get their credentials. Most fitness instructors receive certification for their preferred type of training, such as yoga, kickboxing, or strength training. Many organizations offer certification. For example the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) accredits certifying organizations in the fitness and wellness industry, including several that offer personal trainer or general certification. In addition, some private companies offer certification in the types of classes they offer. Certification exams that have a written portion measure candidates’ knowledge of human physiology, understanding of proper exercise techniques, and ability to assess clients’ fitness levels and develop appropriate exercise programs. Certification also may require the candidate to teach a class for a live or video skills demonstration, which is then assessed by the certifying organization. Most trainers or instructors also need certification in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid, as well as in use of automated external defibrillators (AED). After becoming a certified personal trainer, new trainers may be required to work alongside an experienced trainer before they are allowed to train clients alone. Training for fitness instructors varies greatly. For example, the Yoga Alliance requires 200 and 500 hours of training, depending on the credential. Communication skills. Fitness trainers and instructors must be able to clearly explain exercises that they demonstrate to clients. Customer-service skills.

The American Board of Funeral Service Education (ABFSE) accredits funeral service and mortuary science programs, most of which offer a 2-year associate’s degree at community colleges. Some programs offer a bachelor’s degree. Although an associate’s degree is typically required, some employers prefer applicants to have a bachelor’s degree. Common fields of degree include mortuary science, psychology, and business. High school students can prepare to become a funeral service worker by taking classes in biology, chemistry, business, and public speaking. Students may gain relevant experience working part-time or summer jobs in a funeral home. Those studying to be morticians and funeral arrangers must complete training, usually lasting 1 to 3 years, under the direction of a licensed funeral director or manager. The training, sometimes called an internship or an apprenticeship, may be completed before, during, or after graduating from a funeral service or mortuary science program and passing a national board exam. Most states and Washington, DC, require workers to be licensed. An exception is Colorado, which offers a voluntary certification program. Although licensing laws and examinations vary by state, most applicants must meet the following criteria: Working in multiple states requires multiple licenses. For specific requirements, contact each applicable state licensing board. Most states require funeral directors to earn continuing education credits to keep their licenses.

Licensing requirements for supervisory or managerial positions may differ from those for gambling dealers, gambling and sports book writers and runners, and all other gambling workers. However, all candidates for a license must provide photo identification and pay a fee. Typically, they also must pass an extensive background check and drug test. Failure to pass the background check may prevent candidates from getting a job or a gambling license. Age requirements also vary by state. For specific licensing requirements, visit the state’s gambling commission website. Gambling supervisors and gambling managers usually have several years of experience working in a casino or other gambling establishment. Gambling managers often have experience as a dealer or in the customer outreach department.

Some aspiring models may attend modeling schools that provide training in posing, walking, applying makeup, and other basic tasks. Although some models are discovered when agents scout for “fresh faces” at modeling schools, attending such schools does not necessarily lead to job opportunities. Models advance by working more regularly and being selected for assignments that offer higher pay. They may appear in magazines, print advertising campaigns, commercials, or runway shows that have higher profiles and provide more widespread exposure. Because advancement depends on a model’s previous work, maintaining a good portfolio of high-quality, up-to-date photographs is important in getting assignments. In addition, actively participating in social media and building a large number of followers increases exposure. A model’s selection of an agency is also important for advancement: the better the reputation and skill of the agency, the more assignments a model is likely to get. Specific requirements depend on the client, but most models must be within certain ranges for height, weight, and clothing size. Requirements may change slightly over time as perceptions of physical beauty change. Discipline. A model’s career depends on the person’s maintaining his or her physical characteristics.

They also must complete a number of real estate courses and pass a licensing exam. States typically require licensed agents to have experience before obtaining a broker’s license. In addition to having a high school diploma, real estate brokers and sales agents must complete some real estate courses to be eligible for licensure. Although most brokers and agents must take state-accredited prelicensing courses to become licensed, some states waive this requirement if the candidate has taken college courses in real estate. Some community colleges and 4-year universities offer courses, degree programs, or certificate programs in real estate. These postsecondary credentials typically are not required, but many real estate brokers and sales agents have a bachelor’s degree. Courses in finance, business administration, economics, and law also may be useful. Prospective brokers who plan to open their own company may find it helpful to take business courses, such as marketing and accounting. In addition to offering prelicensing courses, many real estate associations have courses and professional development programs for both beginners and experienced agents. These courses cover a variety of topics, such as real estate fundamentals, real estate law, and mortgage financing. All states require real estate brokers and sales agents to be licensed. Minimum requirements for candidate licensure vary by state but typically include being at least age 18, having a high school diploma or equivalent, completing prelicensing courses, and passing an exam. Some states have additional requirements, such as passing a background check. Licenses typically are not transferable between states. However, some states have reciprocity agreements that streamline the process for brokers and agents licensed in one state to get a license in another state. For a broker’s license, states typically require that candidates have a specified number of years of experience as a licensed sales agent and take additional formal training. In some states, a bachelor’s degree may be substituted for some experience or training requirements. State licenses typically must be renewed every 2 to 4 years. In most states, brokers and agents must complete continuing education courses to renew their license. Prospective brokers and agents should verify requirements with the real estate licensing commission of the state in which they wish to work. Most states require that candidates for a broker’s license have experience working as a licensed real estate sales agent. Requirements vary by state, but most require at least 2 years of experience. Real estate sales agents improve their skills through practice and repetition. Training varies depending on the real estate company. Some provide formal training, while others allow their agents to enter the field immediately after obtaining their license. In some states, agents must be sponsored by a broker while they are working to get their license. Because of the sales environment and the complexity of real estate deals, new agents may observe and work closely with more senior agents. Larger real estate companies may provide formal classroom training for new agents as a way to gain knowledge and experience, while others provide training to employees studying for their real estate licensing exam. The length of training also may vary, depending on the number of real estate transactions in which the agent takes part. Agents involved in a large number of home sales may have a shorter period of on-the-job training than agents involved in few transactions. Sales agents may advance by getting a broker’s license. Brokers may open their own business or work as associate brokers to manage an independent office within a real estate company. Their responsibilities might include hiring, training, and assisting sales agents. Business skills. Because most real estate brokers and sales agents are self-employed, they must be able to manage every aspect of their business, including billing and advertising. Interpersonal skills. Real estate brokers and sales agents spend much of their time interacting with others, such as clients and contractors. They must be pleasant, respectful, and dependable. Organizational skills. Real estate brokers and sales agents must be able to manage their own time for planning and prioritizing their work. Problem-solving skills. Real estate brokers and sales agents must be able to address concerns relating to a property. They also mediate negotiations between a seller and a buyer. Self-motivated.

A common field of degree is business, which usually includes coursework in topics such as finance, accounting, and economics. Summer internships often provide useful experience, and employers may prefer to hire candidates who have worked as interns. Numerous agents eventually get a master’s degree in business administration (MBA), which is often a requirement for high-level positions in the securities industry. Because the MBA exposes students to real-world business practices, it can be a major asset for jobseekers. Employers often reward MBA holders with higher level positions, better compensation, and large signing bonuses. Most employers provide intensive on-the-job training, teaching employees the specifics of the job, such as the products and services offered. Trainees in large firms may receive technical instruction in securities analysis and selling strategies. Firms often rotate their trainees among various departments to give them a broad understanding of the securities business. Securities, commodities, and financial services sales agents must keep up with new products and services and other developments. They attend conferences and training seminars regularly. Brokers and investment bankers must register as representatives of their firm with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). To obtain the license, potential agents must pass a series of exams. Many other licenses are available, each of which gives the holder the right to sell different investment products and services. Traders and some other sales representatives also need licenses, although these vary by firm and specialization. Financial services sales agents may need to be licensed, especially if they sell securities or insurance. Most firms offer training to help their employees pass the licensing exams. Agents who are registered with FINRA must attend continuing education classes to keep their licenses. Courses consist of computer-based training on legal requirements or new financial products or services. Although not always required, certification enhances professional standing and is recommended by employers. Brokers, investment bankers, and financial services sales agents can earn the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certification, sponsored by the CFA Institute. To qualify for this certification, applicants need a bachelor’s degree or 4 years of related work experience and must pass three exams, which require several hundred hours of independent study. Applicants also must have an international passport. Exams cover subjects in accounting, economics, securities analysis, financial markets and instruments, corporate finance, asset valuation, and portfolio management. Applicants can take the exams while they are getting the required work experience. Securities, commodities, and financial services sales agents usually advance to senior positions in a firm by accumulating a greater number of accounts. Although beginners often service the accounts of individual investors, they may eventually service large institutional accounts, such as those of banks and retirement funds. Getting an MBA may also help advancement opportunities. After taking a series of tests, some brokers become portfolio managers and have greater authority to make investment decisions regarding an account. Some experienced sales agents become branch office managers and supervise other sales agents while continuing to provide services for their own clients. A few agents advance to top management positions or become partners in their firms. Many investment banks use an “up or out” policy, in which entry-level investment bankers are either promoted or terminated after 2 or 3 years. Investment banks use this policy to ensure that entry-level positions are not occupied long term, allowing the bank to bring in new workers. Analytical skills. To judge the profitability of potential deals, securities, commodities, and financial services sales agents must have strong analytical skills. This includes computer programming skills which they use to analyze financial products. Customer-service skills. Securities, commodities, and financial services sales agents must be persuasive and make clients feel comfortable with the agent’s recommendations. Decision-making skills.

A field of degree related to the product sold, such as agriculture or biology, is sometimes required. Many sales representatives attend seminars in sales techniques or take courses in marketing, economics, communication, or even a foreign language to improve their ability to make sales. Many companies have formal training programs for beginning wholesale and manufacturing sales representatives. These programs may last up to 1 year. In some, trainees rotate among jobs in plants and offices in order to learn all phases of producing, installing, and distributing the product. In others, trainees receive formal technical instruction at the plant, followed by on-the-job training under the supervision of a field sales manager. New employees may be trained by going along with experienced workers on their sales calls. As they gain familiarity with the firm’s products and clients, the new workers gain more responsibility until they eventually get their own territory. The Certified Professional Manufacturers’ Representative (CPMR) certification and the Certified Sales Professional (CSP) certification are both offered by the Manufacturers’ Representatives Educational Research Foundation (MRERF). Certification typically involves completing formal technical training and passing an exam. In addition, the CPMR requires 10 hours of continuing education every year in order to maintain certification.

Candidates typically need an associate's or bachelor’s degree through a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) program, several years of progressively responsible work experience, or a combination of education and experience. In addition, prospective air traffic controllers must be U.S. citizens and must pass a medical evaluation, background check, and FAA preemployment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery (ATSA). They also must complete a training course at the FAA Academy and apply before the FAA's age cutoff. Once hired, controllers typically complete on-the-job training that lasts more than 12 months. They also must pass a physical exam each year, a job performance exam twice a year, and periodic drug screenings. Air traffic controllers typically need an associate's or a bachelor's degree. To qualify with an associate's degree, candidates must complete their studies in an AT-CTI program. A bachelor's degree may be in any field, including transportation, business, or engineering. The FAA sets guidelines for schools that offer the AT-CTI program. AT-CTI schools offer 2- or 4-year degrees that are designed to prepare students for a career in air traffic control. The curriculum is not standardized, but courses focus on subjects that are fundamental to aviation, including airspace, clearances, chart reading, and federal regulations. Most newly hired air traffic controllers are trained at the FAA Academy in Oklahoma City. The length of training varies with the candidate’s background. Candidates must apply before the FAA's age cutoff. After graduating from the Academy, trainees are assigned to an air traffic control facility as developmental controllers until they complete requirements for becoming a certified air traffic controller. Developmental controllers begin their careers by supplying pilots with basic flight data and airport information. They then may advance to positions within the control room that have more responsibility. With additional training, controllers may switch from one area of specialization to another. For example, a controller may complete training to transfer from working in an en route center to an airport tower. Air traffic controllers sometimes qualify through work experience instead of a degree. Candidates either need up to 3 years of progressively responsible generalized work experience that demonstrates the potential for learning and performing air traffic control work or must have specialized work experience in a military or civilian air traffic control facility. Air traffic controllers who learn their skills in the military are eligible to become civilian air traffic controllers even if their age exceeds the FAA cutoff for applicants. All air traffic controllers must hold an Air Traffic Control Tower Operator Certificate or be appropriately qualified and supervised as stated in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 65. Communication skills. Air traffic controllers must be able to give clear, concise instructions, listen carefully to pilots’ requests, and respond by speaking clearly in English. Decision-making skills. Controllers must make quick decisions. For example, when a pilot requests a change of altitude to avoid poor weather, the controller must respond quickly to ensure the aircraft’s safety. Detail oriented. Controllers must be able to concentrate while multiple conversations occur at once. For example, in a large airport tower, several controllers may be speaking with different pilots at the same time. Math skills. Controllers must be able to do arithmetic accurately and quickly. They often need to compute speeds, times, and distances, and they recommend heading and altitude changes. Organizational skills. Controllers must be able to coordinate the actions of multiple flights and to prioritize tasks, because they may be required to guide several pilots at the same time. Problem-solving skills. Controllers must be able to understand complex situations, review changing circumstances, and provide pilots with appropriate alternatives. Teamwork. Controllers must be able to work as members of a team, cooperating with and assisting others in and around their area of responsibility.","Communication skills., Decision-making skills., Detail oriented., Math skills., Organizational skills., Problem-solving skills., Teamwork.",

Commercial pilots typically need flight training, and some employers may require or prefer them to have a degree. Airline and commercial pilots also must have specific certificates and ratings from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Airline pilots typically need a bachelor’s degree in any field, including transportation, engineering, or business. They also complete flight training with independent FAA-certified flight instructors or at schools that offer flight training. Commercial pilots typically complete flight training, and some employers require or prefer that they have a degree. The FAA certifies hundreds of civilian flight schools, which range from small fixed base operators (FBO) to state universities. Some colleges and universities offer pilot training as part of a 2- or 4-year aviation degree. Airline and commercial pilots who are newly hired by airlines or on-demand air services companies undergo on-the-job training in accordance with federal regulations. This training usually includes several weeks of ground school and flight training. Various types of ratings for specific aircraft, such as the Boeing 737 or Cessna Citation, typically are acquired through employer-based training and generally are earned by pilots who have at least a commercial pilot certificate. Pilots also must maintain their experience in performing certain maneuvers. This requirement means that pilots must perform specific maneuvers and procedures a given number of times within a specified amount of time. Pilots also must undergo periodic training and medical examinations, generally every year or every other year. Airline pilots typically need work experience as a commercial or military pilot. To get a job with a major or regional airline, pilots need extensive flight experience. Some pilots work as flight instructors or on-demand charter pilots, positions that usually require less experience than airline jobs require, to help build enough flying hours so that they can apply to the airlines. Military pilots may transfer to civilian aviation and apply directly to airlines to become airline pilots. Those who are seeking a career as a professional pilot must meet FAA requirements. Pilots typically get their FAA-issued certificates and ratings in the following order: Each certificate and rating requires that pilots pass a knowledge test on the ground and a practical flying exam, usually called a check ride, in an appropriate aircraft. In addition to earning these credentials, many pilots get a flight instructor certificate after they get their commercial pilot certificate. The flight instructor certificate helps them build flight time and experience quickly and at less personal expense. Commercial pilot certificate. To qualify for a commercial pilot certificate, applicants must meet age and flight-hour requirements. Student pilots use a logbook and keep detailed records of their flight time, which must be endorsed by a flight instructor. Federal regulations specify the types and quantities of flight experience and knowledge needed. Applicants must pass the appropriate medical exam, meet all of the detailed flight experience and knowledge requirements, and pass a written exam and a practical flight exam in order to get a commercial pilot certificate. The medical exam confirms that the pilot’s vision is correctable to 20/20 and that no physical or mental conditions exist that could impair the pilot’s performance. Commercial pilots must hold an instrument rating if they want to carry passengers for pay more than 50 miles from the point of origin of their flight, or at night. Instrument rating. Pilots who earn an instrument rating can fly during periods of low visibility, also known as instrument meteorological conditions, or IMC. They may qualify for this rating by having at least 40 hours of instrument flight experience and 50 hours of cross-country flight time as pilot in command, and by meeting other requirements detailed in the federal regulations. Airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate. All pilot crews of a scheduled commercial airliner must have ATP certificates. To earn the ATP certificate, applicants must meet certain federal requirements, such as for age, hours of flight, and written and practical exams. A commercial pilot certificate is a prerequisite for the ATP. Airline pilots usually maintain one or more aircraft-type ratings, which allow them to fly aircraft that require specific training, depending on the requirements of their particular airline. Pilots must pass periodic physical and practical flight examinations to be able to perform the duties granted by their certificate. Commercial pilots may advance to airline pilots after completing a degree, accruing required flight time, and obtaining an ATP certificate. Advancement for airline pilots depends on a system of seniority outlined in collective bargaining contracts. Communication skills. Pilots must speak clearly when conveying information to air traffic controllers and other crew members. They must also listen carefully for instructions. Observational skills. Pilots regularly watch over screens, gauges, and dials to make sure that all systems are in working order. They also need to maintain situational awareness by looking for other aircraft or obstacles. Pilots must be able to see clearly, be able to judge the distance between objects, and possess good color vision. Problem-solving skills. Pilots must be able to identify complex problems and figure out appropriate solutions. When a plane encounters turbulence, for example, pilots assess the weather conditions and request a change in route or altitude from air traffic control. Quick reaction time.

However, employers may prefer to hire workers who have postsecondary education, such as coursework, a certificate, or an associate’s or bachelor’s degree. Locomotive engineers typically receive 3 or more months of on-the-job training before they can operate a train on their own. Typically, this training involves riding with an experienced engineer. In addition, railroad companies provide continuing education so that engineers can maintain their skills. Most railroad companies have up to 12 months of on-the-job training for conductors and yardmasters. Amtrak (the passenger train company) and some of the larger freight railroad companies operate their own training programs. Small and regional railroads may send conductors to a central training facility or a community college. Yardmasters may be sent to training programs or may be trained by an experienced yardmaster. Rail yard engineers and signal and switch operators also receive on-the-job training, typically through a company training program. This program may last a few weeks to a few months, depending on the company and the complexity of the job. The program may include both classroom instruction and hands-on training under the direction of an experienced employee. Most locomotive engineers first work as conductors or yardmasters for several years. Locomotive engineers and conductors must be certified by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). The certifications, conducted by the railroad that employs them, involve a written knowledge test, a skills test, and a supervisor determination that the engineer or conductor understands all physical aspects of the particular route on which he or she will be operating. Engineers who change routes must be recertified for the new route. Even engineers and conductors who do not switch routes must be recertified every few years. At the end of the certification process, the engineer must pass a vision and hearing test. Conductors who operate on national, regional, or commuter railroads are also required to become certified. To receive certification, new conductors must pass a test that has been designed and administered by the railroad and approved by the FRA. In addition, railroad workers must be at least 21 years of age and pass a background test. They must also pass random drug and alcohol screenings over the course of their employment.

There are no educational requirements for entry-level sailors and marine oilers, but other water transportation workers typically complete U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)-approved training programs. Most water transportation jobs require the Transportation Worker Identification Credential from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and a Merchant Mariner Credential, plus related endorsements, from the Coast Guard. Sailors and marine oilers typically do not need a formal educational credential to enter the occupation. Other water transportation workers complete U.S. Coast Guard-approved training programs. Employers may prefer to hire candidates who have earned a bachelor’s degree from a maritime academy. For example, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy offers a bachelor’s degree program and a Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC) with an endorsement as a third mate or third assistant engineer. Academy graduates must serve several years as an officer in a reserve unit or on active duty in any branch of the Armed Forces. Water transportation workers may receive on-the-job training of varying duration. For example, sailors and marine oilers typically need 1 month to 1 year of training after they are hired. The size and type of ship and waterway also affect training, with large vessels on open seas likely to require the most training. Some water transportation workers enter their occupation through an apprenticeship. The length of these programs varies but may last several years. Apprenticeship programs typically include technical instruction and paid on-the-job training aboard a vessel. Those who successfully complete an apprenticeship may be eligible to take the exam for ship engineer or third mate. The USCG and TSA have specific requirements for many water transportation workers. These requirements may include passing a security or drug screening, completing approved training, or passing written and physical examinations. Workers in some occupations, such as maritime pilots, also may need a license issued by their state. For example, mariners working on ships with U.S. flags usually need a TSA Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC). Mariners who work on ships traveling on the open ocean require USCG-verified training for the Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping (STCW) endorsement. Most mariners also must have a USCG-issued MMC. (More information on MMCs and related endorsements is available from the U.S. Coast Guard National Maritime Center.) In addition, water transportation workers may need a valid passport, other licenses or credentials, and first aid or other safety certification. With the exception of sailors and marine oilers, water transportation workers typically need several years of maritime experience to enter these occupations. Workers require this experience, commonly known as “sea time,” to advance from lower level positions into higher level ones. For example, a marine oiler must have at least 3 years of experience to become a third engineer, who then needs experience to become a second engineer, and so on. Graduates of a maritime academy gain some of the required experience as part of their educational program, as do those who complete an apprenticeship. Customer-service skills.
